        What is PoE and why is it important in networking?
      </p>
      <p id="p2" class="pag">
        PoE or Power over Ethernet is a new technology that allows the network
        cable to transmit electrical energy in addition to data transmission.
        For example, consider a CCTV camera that we plan to install in the
        exterior of the building Another advantage of structured cabling is its
        use for power transmission using PoE technology, which stands for
        Power-over-Ethernet. PoE is suitable for devices such as wireless
        repeaters or network surveillance cameras; Because these devices are
        usually installed on the high points of the walls or ceiling and far
        from the electrical outlet. The use of PoE in these devices makes them
        need only one Ethernet cable to transmit voice, data and power..

        What is the use of the network? What is a network? In words, it is a
        group of people or objects that are able to share information in a
        meaningful way with each other. In the concepts of information
        technology, "computer networks" or "data network" is called "network"
        for short, which means that computers are tools and objects that share
        information in an understandable way. At a higher and conceptual level,
        data networks include nodes that computers and digital devices can
        transfer messages between nodes through links and physical
        communications (wired and wireless).
